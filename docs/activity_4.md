# Activity 004

This exercise gives you the opportunity to explore classes, Date/Time and unit tests in Scala.

### Instructions
Given a moment in time (represented as a date/time value), your job is to write a program to find the moment that would be after a gigasecond has passed.

A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

### Add additional unit tests

You'll see some starter unit tests in [Exercise004Test.scala](../src/test/scala/com/techreturners/exercise004/Exercise004Test.scala)

Your job is to add additional unit tests and make all the unit tests pass.

Feel free to structure your code however you prefer to solve the exercise.

We'd like to see clean code, so please keep clear separation of concerns, and the D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in mind.
